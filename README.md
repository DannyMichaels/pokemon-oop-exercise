 Create a quick Pokémon game where 2 pokemons fight against each other. For This we need to:

# CREATE A POKÉMON CLASS

## 1. Create 2 new instances of Pokemon (new pokemons)
### Each pokemon will have these attributes:
- name
- type
- HP (health points)
- IMPORTANT: if we do not specify the HP, it will be 100 by default.

## 2. Be able to control when a pokemon:
- attacks
- misses the attack
- lands a critical hit
- faints (loses the battle)


# CREATE A BATTLE CLASS

 1. Initialize a battle between 2 pokémons that we pass as arguments
 2. Start a battle where both pokémons will take turns to attack until one loses (HP equals 0)
 3. Output the winner.
